 *  The child classes listed above represent the different types of goals that
 *  define these habits/skills.
 *
 *  A weekly task is one in which the user has the goal of completing once a
 *  week, such as taking out the trash.
 *
 *The WeeklyTask class is similar to the DailyTask class in that it contains
 * fields for current streak and best streak, as well as methods to get these
 * values. However, for the WeeklyTask class, the current and best streak
 * pertains to the number of weeks in a row (as opposed to days in  row).
