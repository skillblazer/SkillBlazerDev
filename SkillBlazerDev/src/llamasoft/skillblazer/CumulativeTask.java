 * Description:
 * 
 * This child class is one of the kind of tasks that represent 
 * the different types of goals that define these 
 * habits/skills.
 * 
 * A cumulative task is one in which the user sets a deadline 
 * for completing, such as reading 12 books by July 2018.
 *
 * The CumulativeTask class has a field that holds the end 
 * date for a goal asset by the user. There is a method to 
 * set this date, a method to get this date, and a method to 
 * check the percentage that a goal has been reached by
 * the user (e.g. 50% of books read of overall goal).
